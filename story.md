#### Leprechaun Tools Story
By Megaf
Leprechauns are actually miners! I manage to find their secret place where unfortunetaly I couldn't find any pot of gold.
Instead, I found a strange kind of crystal, it was green and shiny. These Leprechauns are actually masters of crafting and smelting and they have figured out a way to create a new material from the mix of Mese and Diamond, two of the most durable materials on the Voxel world.
They arrange Mese and Diamond in a very specific way in order to make what they call Leprechaun Crystal!
After artificially creating this crystal, they use it to craft Leprechaun Pickaxes! And that's how they have succeed in finding so many gold to make their coins.
I have succefully reverse engineering their process and managed to bring it to Minetest So now you can too use this fantastic pickaxe made out of Leprechaun Crystal. I went even further, you can actually make axes, swords and shovels with it.
Please, keep in mind that this is a very delicate proccess and it's a work in progress. Bugs are specially atracted to the Leprachun crystal due to it's shiny green look. So you will probably find lot's of bugs in it.
Also, I'm having to type this very quicly because I have been followed by Leprechauns who don't want me to share their secret to the World, so you might find some spelling mistakes and typos!
