## Leprechaun Tools Story
### By Megaf
#### Leprechauns are actually miners! I manage to find their secret place where unfortunetaly I couldn't find any pot of gold.
#### Instead, I found a strange kind of crystal, it was green and shinny. These Leprechaun are actually masters of crafting and smelting and they have figured out a out to creat a new material from the mix of Mese and Diamond, two of the most durable materials on the Voxel world.
#### They arrenge Mese and Diamond in a very specific way in order to create what they call, Leprechaun Crystal!
#### After artificially creating this crystal, they use it to craft Leprechaun Pickaxes! And that's how them succeed in finding so many gold to make their coins!
### I have succefully reverse engineering their process and manage to bring it to Minetest, so now you can too use this fantastic pickaxe, and I went even further, you can actually making axes, swords and shovels with it.
#### Please, keep in mind that this is a very delicate proccess and it's a work in progress. Bugs are specially atracted by the Leprachun crystal due to it's shinny green look. So you will probably find lot's of bugs in it.
##### Also, I'm having to type this very quicly because I have been followed by Leprechaun who don't want me to share their secret to the World, so you might find some spelling mistakes and typos!
#### Free free to fork this repositorio and help me correcting bugs and spelling and improve this that is one of the most exciting mods ever!
